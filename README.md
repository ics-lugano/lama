This is the repository for the MOOSE module used in the article "Contact between rough rock surfaces using a dual mortar method" (2020) in IJRMMS. Due to new versions of MOOSE, PETSc, and MAC OSX we are currently still porting the module to newer versions. If you want to use the older version, please contact us directly.
